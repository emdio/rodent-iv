These are guide books intended for use with Rodent IV chess engine.
They should be used in conjunction with a main book (rodent.bin)
and are meant to guide the game stylistically.

active.bin - seeks dynamic positions, based on Kasparov's games without
QGD but with Benoni thrown in to stir things up.

cat.bin - Catalan, classical Queen's Indian, g3 KID as White, Grunfeld, accelerated Dragon,
Modern and Alekhine (!) as Black. Needs a real book in reserve.

cs.bin - d4, occasionally c4 as White, Caro-Kann and Slav as Black, occasionally 
tries Nimzo-Indian. Requires strong main book, as it choses sharp lines.

closed.bin - French and King's Indian as black, d4 and e4 as white.

empty.bin - empty book. Can be declared as a main book for weak personalities
if we want limited opening knowledge.

flank.bin - plays flank openings, likes fianchettoing bishops;
based on games by Tomasz Markowski with some lines added by hand.

grandpa.bin - small book, Caro + Tarrasch as main Black options, Ruy + Nimzo as a backup,
prefers d4 to e4 as White

low.bin - minimal book which tries to start with a couple of moves that
do not reach the 4th or the 5th rank.

solid.bin - Karpov + Uhlmann

tricky.bin - Morozevich's games + a lot of handcrafting. Wide and tricky.
